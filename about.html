                        <p class="students-para"> Adult fiction audiences are thirty and older, and therefore the writing style for this demographic is often worldly and more complex. <br> In fiction writing for adults, the protagonist typically has reflective and introspective inner thoughts. <br> The themes of the story are also mature and relevant to readers who have more life experiences.</p>
